        <h1>Problem</h1>
        <p>Academics have collected lots of information on how people learn but it has not been translated into a
            practical structured resource for teachers.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h1>Mission</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide a structured framework</li>
            <li>for supporting different learning styles</li>
            <li> in an accessible format for teachers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>What is POWS?</h1>
        <p>Picture, Object, Words and Story</p>
        <p>Are the 4 elements that make up a great lesson, if a teacher can use these 4 areas to teach a subject the
            majority of different learning styles are covered. This will help engage all students and help them learning
            in a personalised way.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h1>Who is it for?</h1>
        <p>It is for everyone, as everyone learns in different ways.</p>
        <p>Lots of academic research has done into the different ways people learn, these are called learning styles,
            the main ones are: visual, verbal, kinasthetic and contextual.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h1>How does POWS work?</h1>
        <p>In order to make POWS easily accessible for teachers, activities are going to be stored in an online
            database.</p>
        <p>Each activity will have access to the resources needed to teach it, these resources can be then easily edited
            to suit the particular needs of the teacher.</p>
        <p>Teachers can also search by topic and POWS for relevant activities that can be combined together to make a
            lesson.</p>
        <p>Lessons can then be saved and shared with other teachers.</p>
